# Cell-Visualization-Blender
For my [Master thesis](Master_Thesis_Eric_Schmidt.pdf), I was working on 3D mouse embryonic stem cells. I was evaluating cell interface dynamics of these cells. To visualize my results, I was using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and especially Python to automatize the workflow. Here are the scripts for the visualization in blender stored.

If you use blender in Linux and want to run the scripts in debug mode, then open blender from the console via

```bash
blender -d
```

The scripts for handling the data are confidential. The thesis and the visualizations are open available.
